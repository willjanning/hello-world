My name is Will. I am a sophomore at Ohio State University majoring in either electrical engineering or computer engineering, I am not sure which yet. This summer I have really been learning a lot about programming. I have done a lot with C++ and Python. This all started when I wanted to make a musical Tesla coil at the beginning of the summer, and one rabbit hole led to the other and now I am fully entrenched in learning to code. Today is June 15, 2020. This summer has been super crazy so far, as Coronavirus has been ever-present since February and we were in quarantine for a long time. I do not really know what is going to happen next. This whole ordeal has reminded me how our society isn't as all-powerful as we like to think of it. A tiny  virus can cripple our entire civilization, which is somewhat scary to think about. I hope that we can come together as a country and as a world to confront Coronavirus and other more perennial problems, like global warming.
